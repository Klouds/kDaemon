____

*A RESTful API framework for managing containers over a set of Docker Nodes.*

*Will also run a watcher process that will monitor, fix and rebalance containers on the cluster.*

___
# Features
___
* Easily mount new docker nodes through either REST calls or the Web UI
* Create a persistant application library of Docker applications to launch at will
* Balances containers across the cluster in a containers-per-node manner (at present)
* Maintains container uptime by routinely health-checking the cluster

___
## WEB UI
___

Web UI for interacting with kDaemon:
[kDaemon_UI][kDaemon_UI]





Full stack design can be read here 
     [Development Plan][Development Plan] and here
     [Daemon Design] [Daemon Design]

___
## THE STACK
___

*The stack consists of multiple docker endpoints exposing their APIs to their internal network (or VPN) and managing the state of the cluster from a central location.*

```
    docker --\                    
    docker -->kDaemon                                     
    docker __/   

```

___
## Dependencies
____

+ Your nodes need to be running the docker API 
+ 
```
sudo docker -H 0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -d 
```

+ Rethinkdb with database name of rethinkdb_dbname and tables
    - containers
    - nodes
    - applications
    
+ You should have golang 1.5+ available on your machine.
+ kDaemon is only tested on Linux. Any machine with an exposed Docker API should be able to become a node however.

___
# Running the Application
___
    

## Configuration -- config/app.conf

```
    [default]
    bind_ip = 0.0.0.0               # IP to bind API to
    api_port = 1337                 # Port to bind API to
    rethinkdb_host = 127.0.0.1      # RethinkDB Host
    rethinkdb_port = 28015          # RethinkDB Port
    rethinkdb_dbname = kdaemon      # RethinkDB database name
    api_version = 0.0               # Current API version. (You probably shouldnt change this)

```



___
## To build (linux):
___


```
    go get github.com/superordinate/kDaemon
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/superordinate/kDaemon
    go build .
```

___
## To Run
___

``` 
./kDaemon
```

___
## How to use
___

*You can interact with kDaemon in several ways. The easiest way to get started is to use our web-ui at:*
[http://github.com/klouds/kdaemon_ui.][kDaemon_UI] 

If you're interested in working directly with the REST APIs, you here's some documentation for you:

___
#### Adding a node
___

To add a node, you can POST to **bind_ip:api_port/%API_VERSION%/nodes/create**
```
    {
        "name":"Host1",
        "d_ipaddr":"127.0.0.1",
        "d_port": "2375",
    }
```

___
#### Adding an application
___

To add an application, you can POST to **bind_ip:api_port/%API_VERSION%/applications/create**
```
    {
        "name":"ghost-blog",
        "exposed_ports":"2368",
        "docker_image": "ghost"
    }
```
___
#### Create a container
___

To create a container on your most available node, you can POST to **bind_ip:api_port/%API_VERSION%/containers/create**

*note: The application_id is generated when adding a new application.*

```
    {
        "name":"ghost-blog-ozzadar",
        "application_id":75186c59-ec80-49d6-beb5-1bfac76e8525
    }
```
___
#### Launch a container
___
**POST** to **bind_ip:api_port/%API_VERSION%/container/launch/%CONTAINER_ID%**
___
## API Reference
___

UPDATED (Feb 25 2016) -- 

    1) adding a start container command to the list. Separating container creation/launch from each other because what was I thinking?
    2) moved endpoints to /action/id to get rid of annoying pathing errors.

```

 * POST     /%API_VERSION%/nodes/create             -- Creates a node
 * PATCH    /%API_VERSION%/nodes/update/id          -- Edits a node
 * DELETE   /%API_VERSION%/nodes/delete/id          -- Deletes a node
 * GET      /%API_VERSION%/nodes/id                 -- Gets node information
 * GET      /%API_VERSION%/nodes                    -- Gets all nodes


 * POST     /%API_VERSION%/applications/create      -- Creates an application in the database
 * PATCH    /%API_VERSION%/applications/update/id   -- Edits an application
 * DELETE   /%API_VERSION%/applications/delete/id   -- Deletes an application
 * GET      /%API_VERSION%/applications/id          -- Gets application information
 * GET      /%API_VERSION%/applications             -- Gets all applications


 * POST /%API_VERSION%/containers/create            -- Creates a container on the cluster
 * POST /%API_VERSION%/containers/launch/id         -- Launches a container on the cluster
 * POST /%API_VERSION%/containers/launch/id         -- Stops a container on the cluster
 * PATCH /%API_VERSION%/containers/update/id        -- Edits a container 
 * DELETE /%API_VERSION%/containers/delete/id       -- Deletes a container 


 * GET /%API_VERSION%/containers/id                 -- Gets container information
 * GET /%API_VERSION%/containers                    -- Gets all containers
